 Backrooms-inspired randomly generated maze. Press escape to quit.

Features:
Maze will change on you.
It's really dark.
Victorian grandparent's house/hotel inspired style.

Bugs:
 Fullscreen now works too well. Sorry :/
 Sometimes you can spawn close to the edge of the map.
 Rarely, you will spawn in a 2x2 square.
